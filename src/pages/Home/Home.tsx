      ðŸ‘€ Some activities that you can do
    </Typography>
    <Typography component="p">
      It's up to you to implement whatever you want at the application, however here we will have some proposals for
      practicing:
    </Typography>
    <List>
      <ListItem sx={{ display: 'list-item' }}><Typography>Add error state to the <code>AuthState</code>and to the <code>Login</code></Typography></ListItem>
      <ListItem sx={{ display: 'list-item' }}><Typography>Create some Profile page and extend the current <code>AuthState</code></Typography></ListItem>
      <ListItem sx={{ display: 'list-item' }}><Typography>Implement the <code>Logout</code>at header.</Typography></ListItem>
      <ListItem sx={{ display: 'list-item' }}><Typography>Extract the conditions for authentication to a domain.</Typography></ListItem>
      <ListItem sx={{ display: 'list-item' }}><Typography>Implement the view where you will see all the buses.</Typography></ListItem>
      <ListItem sx={{ display: 'list-item' }}><Typography>Connect the <code>Create Bus</code>page with api, validating the form.</Typography></ListItem>
      <ListItem sx={{ display: 'list-item' }}><Typography>Keep the <code>AuthState</code>also when you close and open the browser.`</Typography></ListItem>
    </List>
    <Blockquote>
      <Typography>ðŸš§ Some smells have been introduced at the application, so is up to you to remark it in some way or refactor if you
      consider it.</Typography>
    </Blockquote>
    <Typography component="p">
      Remember, this is a Kata and the most important thing is to learn and have fun! ðŸŽ‰.
